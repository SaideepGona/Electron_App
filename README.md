This is a desktop app being created using the electron framework. The goal is to create an organizational helper for bioinformatics scientists/those working with bioinformatics data. Given the expected influx of high-throughput studies, finding, curating, and storing the study metadata reasonably is important. This will serve as a tool to:

1.) Find new studies via NCBI's Entrez API, followed by a specialized filtering algorithm to present most likely targets to the user. 
2.) Store study metadata and carefully manage local repositories.
3.) Serve as a platform for certain data pre-processing tasks.

Ultimately, the intention here is to simplify tasks that current researchers likely spend unneccesary time on. Style points for doing so with a nice user interface distinct from the bare bones styles that seem to dominate the field.
