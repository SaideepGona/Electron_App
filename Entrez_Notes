Notes about the Entrez E-Utilities for development and general reference. Based off the lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCFVVexp30o&t=1030s

- Each record has a unique integer ID (UID)
- Each unique database has their own representation of ID

- Basic Functions

    - ESearch
        - Input: Text-query
        - Output: Set of UIDs
    - ESummary
        - Input: Set of UIDs
        - Output: Record Summaries
    - EFetch
        - Input: Set of UIDs
        - Output: Full Data Records
    - ELink
        - Input: Set of UIDs from a database
        - Output: Set of UIDs from another database pertaining to the same topic
    - EPost
        - Input: Set of UIDs
        - Output: Uploads to servers

- ESearch & ESummary

    - Constructing an ESearch URL
        - Base URL (Common in ALL database queries): http://eutils.ncbi.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/
        - ESearch Indicator (Specifies this as an ESearch): esearch.fcgi?
        - Database and Terms (Actual search fields): db=*your database*&term=*your search*
        - Base URL + ESearch Indicator + Database and Terms = Full ESearch URL
        - Remember to use standard web encodings
    - ESearch Output
        - XML document
        - Count: Number of Records
        - RetMax: Max number of Records UIDs returned 
        - RetStart: Identifier of starting record being listed
        - IdList: List of record UIDs being returned
    - What about an ESummary URL
        - ESummary Indicator: esummary.fcgi?
        - db field is the same, but term is replaced by id. 
        - UIDs are given seperated by commas following "id="
        - You can also use another field "&usehistory=y" to return a key to your search
            - Worth looking into for later
    - ESummary returns docsums

- EFetch
